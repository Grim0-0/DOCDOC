# DOCDOC
This website leverages the advanced capabilities of the [LayoutLMv2] (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/layoutlm2) AI model to classify uploaded document images into 16 predefined categories such as letters, forms, emails, resumes, and memos. Hosted on a user-friendly platform developed using the Django framework, the website offers a streamlined experience for users needing efficient document management and classification.

**Key Features:**
Document Classification: At the core of DOCDOC is the ability to automatically classify scanned document images. Users can upload images directly through the interface, and the system, powered by LayoutLMv2, categorizes them based on their content and layout.
User-Friendly Interface: The website features a simple, intuitive interface designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This design ensures ease of navigation and minimalistic user interaction, making document management accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
Secure Uploads: We prioritize security and privacy, ensuring that all uploads are handled securely and data is processed with the utmost confidentiality.
Real-Time Processing: The integration of LayoutLMv2 with Django allows for real-time document classification, providing immediate feedback and classifications to users once documents are uploaded.
Accessibility Features: The website is designed to be accessible, with attention to user-friendly readouts for classified documents, enabling users with disabilities to interact effectively with the platform.
**Technologies Used:**
LayoutLMv2: This model is a cornerstone of our document classification system. It has been fine-tuned on a diverse dataset including the RVL-CDIP subset, which enables it to understand and classify a wide range of document types.
Django Framework: Our choice of Django for the backend development supports robust data handling and user management capabilities, making it ideal for handling sensitive information with efficiency.
Front-End Development: Developed with modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the front end of the website provides a responsive and adaptive user experience across different devices and browsers.
**Potential Use Cases:**
Enterprise Document Management: Enterprises that handle large volumes of documents can use DOCDOC to streamline their document management processes, reducing the manual labor involved in categorizing and storing documents.
Academic Research: Researchers who deal with extensive archives of printed material can use this tool to sort and categorize their documents, making it easier to retrieve and organize research materials.
Legal Document Sorting: Law firms can use DOCDOC to classify various legal documents, helping paralegals and lawyers to focus on analysis and case preparation without getting bogged down by document management tasks.
**Future Enhancements:**
Machine Learning Enhancements: Future updates will include training on additional datasets and possibly integrating newer models such as LayoutLMv3 to improve accuracy and expand the range of recognizable documents.
Multi-Language Support: To cater to a global audience, we plan to incorporate multi-language support, allowing non-English documents to be classified with the same accuracy and efficiency.
Advanced Security Features: Enhancing data security protocols to ensure that all documents are processed in a secure environment, maintaining confidentiality and integrity.
DOC DOC stands at the intersection of AI and practical utility, providing a robust solution for automated document classification that is scalable, secure, and highly efficient.
